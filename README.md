## Star Quiz

### Log-in / registration optional (Home Screen)
To begin the app, we want the user to provide information for authorization (log-in). 
This is also the screen where users would register and create their profiles. 
All this will lead towards the following important functions. 

### Username textbox (Home Screen)
Interacts with taken and banned username databases. 
Submit button to submit and progress to next screen (info screen).

### Hashing Passwords (Home Screen)
Allows the encryption and decryption of 
login passwords for the purpose of security.

### Theme Screen (Home Screen)
This changes the background of the application.
### Leaderboard (Home Screen)
Allows users to see a specific leaderboard 
(leaderboards for different categories of the quiz).

## Risks and Mitigation
Risk of poor time management, which could result in late delivery of app or 
different modules during the app creation phase.
- Schedule meetings throughout the week to measure progress.
- Reassess throughout if the tentative timeline and goals need to be adjusted as needed.

Group size decreases due to student(s) withdrawing from class.
- Reassess the extra work that will need to be reassigned to remaining team members. 
Reassess the timeline of future goals and adjust as needed.

Copyright infringement accusations (star trek theme) app may be taken down.
- Don’t name the app anything related to Star Trek and don’t monetize in order to keep it free use.

Lack of understanding of Android app development, which could result in a subpar product
- Try to look at online tutorials to get used to developing apps on Android Studio.
- Practice Android app development over the course of the semester. The more 
  we practice and get used to 
  Android Studio’s UI and functions, we can complete the project more 
  efficiently with a better looking final product.
- Reading the documentation. Getting a basic understanding of Android app 
  development will help us for the project.

Having no creative designers for the design of what the app will look like that is most appealing
- Learn how to create appealing designs through Youtube tutorials
- Receive input from others on potential designs
- Test out different designs and see what “feels” right.
